# User Behavior Classification and Battery Optimization Project

This project analyzes mobile user behavior by applying machine learning techniques such as clustering and classification. Key areas of focus include:

- Clustering Analysis: Using K-Means to segment users based on app usage, screen time, and battery drain patterns.
- Classification Model: Predicting user behavior class with a Random Forest Classifier, achieving 100% accuracy.
- Battery Optimization: Providing personalized battery optimization recommendations based on user behavior patterns.

The project demonstrates strong performance in predicting user classes and offers actionable insights for optimizing mobile battery life.
